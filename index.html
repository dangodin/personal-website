							<h2>Hello, World</h2>
							<p>I graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2007 with a degree in Computer Engineering.<p>
							<p>When not designing, fixing, and tinkering, you might find me riding a bike around Vancouver, rock climbing up in Squamish, or out somewhere on an adventure.</p>
							<p>Cooking is another passion of mine (albeit a work in progress). From an Engineer's perspective, ingredients are simply the components, utensils the tools, and the kitchen a laboratory.</p>

					<h2>Startups and Young Tech</h2>
					<p>There are many reasons to like Vancouver: the foodie culture, the active lifestyle, and vibrant summers. There is also that young creative energy that has empowered many great local startups.</p>
					<p>Some days working with a startup can be an exercise in throwing your job description out the window (well, not entirely) and doing whatever is necessary to make the business successful. This takes a certain curiosity, adaptability and drive.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 aboutme">
					<h2>Sales Engineering</h2>
					<p>An effective Sales Engineer is a good consultant. The process starts by analyzing business objectives to understand the big picture then driving down into technical goals and needs.</p>
					<p>Using a consultative sales approach results in designing the correct solution for a customer's needs and builds stronger longer-lasting relationships.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-8 aboutme">
					<h2>Systems Integration</h2>
					<p>Every system engineered is a system to deploy and integrate, often into complex IT environments. We can only do so much in terms of pre-planning and risk mitigation before being left to the whims of our customer's environment.</p>
					</p>Being flexible and taking a consultative approach allows us to deal with unforeseen circumstances efficiently and professionally, creating an overall positive customer experience.</p>

					<img src="../images/raspberry-pi.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block img-project" alt="Raspberry Pi" >
					<h2>RPi Media Center</h2>
					<p>Raspberry Pi (RPi) can be an inexpensive, fun little toy for geeks. Embedded with a low cost, low power ARM processor it has use as a web server, a media center, or an Internet of Things (IoT) node or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motes" target="_blank">mote</a>. My personal RPi currently runs the <a href="http://openelec.tv/" target="_blank">OpenElec</a> media center software.</p>
					<p>The RPi is quick to set up, requiring only basic Linux skills. The result: remarkably smooth streaming of high definition video from a networked hard drive.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
					<img src="../images/bootstrap-www.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block img-project" alt="Bootstrap">
					<h2>Bootstrap Website</h2>
					<p>The geniuses at Twitter released their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_%28front-end_framework%29" target="_blank">Bootstrap framework</a> as open source in 2011 and it is a great way to spin up consistent clean looking website front-ends relatively quickly. This very website is designed using Bootstrap, and it did not take long.</p>
					<p>You can find Bootstrap powering many popular web apps and it appears to be an excellent platform for this purpose.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
					<img src="../images/www-cloud.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block img-project" alt="Cloud Hosted">
					<h2>Cloud Hosting</h2>
					<p>In the heated struggle between my website and media center for Raspberry Pi domination, the media center eventually won out. Thus, the shunned but resilient website needed some good ol' fashion cloud hosting to really shine.</p>
					<p>There are ever increasing options for low cost cloud hosting and they are easier than ever to spin up. I chose <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/ target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> primarily based on price. After installing Apache, writing a couple quick backup scripts, and migrating the site over it is now running beautifully.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
					<img src="../images/GoogleAnalyticsIcon.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block img-project" alt="Google Analytics">
					<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
					<p>Many companies use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> to gather detailed statistics that help them measure, understand, and optimize website usage behaviour. However, one thing that can be said about using it for your personal website, it's probably a clear indication that you are a data junky.</p>
					<p>Deploying this service is as simple as signing up for a free (basic) account and pasting a snippet of JavaScript code onto each webpage that you wish to to monitor.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
					<img src="../images/Wikipedia-logo.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block img-project" alt="Wikipedia: Compass Card">
					<h2>Wikipedia: Translink Compass Card</h2>
					<p>One of my ongoing goals for 2014 is to make regular (weekly or so) contributions to Wikipedia, either as new articles or edits to existing content. Read my inaugural article on Translink's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_Card_%28Translink%29" target="_blank">Compass Card</a>, soon to be the primary payment system for all Bus, SkyTrain, Seabus, and West Coast Express transit fares in Metro Vancouver.</p>
					<p>Consider contributing to Wikipedia if you use it yourself and keep this amazing information machine alive.</p>
